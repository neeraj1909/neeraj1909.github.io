<h1>1.3.4  Induction and Recursion</h1>
<h3><p>Failure to find a counter example to a given algorithm does not mean "it is obvious" that the algorithm is correct. A proof or demonstration of correctness is needed. Often mathematical induction is the method of choice<br>
  When I first learned about mathematical induction it seemed like complete magic. You proved a formula for some basic case like 1 or 2, then assumed it was true all the way to n-1 before proving it was true for general n using the assumption. That was a proof? Ridiculous!<br>
